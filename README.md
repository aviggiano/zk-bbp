# zk-bbp

A trustless bug bounty system using zero-knowledge proofs to solve the trust issue between whitehats and projects. Whitehats can prove they have found a critical vulnerability without revealing the exploit details until payout is guaranteed.

## The Problem

Traditional bug bounty programs suffer from a fundamental trust issue:

1. **Whitehat discovers a vulnerability** that could result in significant fund loss
2. **Whitehat provides proof-of-concept** showing the exploit works  
3. **Project refuses to pay** but keeps the information and fixes the bug
4. **Whitehat loses out** despite providing valuable security research

This creates a disincentive for security researchers to report critical vulnerabilities, potentially leaving projects exposed to malicious actors.

## The Solution

ZK-BBP uses zero-knowledge proofs to enable **trustless bug bounty payouts**:

1. **Whitehat generates a ZK proof** that demonstrates:
   - They know an exploit that causes loss â‰¥ threshold amount
   - Without revealing the actual exploit details
2. **Smart contract verifies the proof** and holds funds in escrow
3. **Automatic payout** occurs when proof is valid
4. **Whitehat reveals exploit** after guaranteed payment
